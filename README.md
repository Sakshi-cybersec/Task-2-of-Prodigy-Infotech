# Task-2-of-Prodigy-Infotech
I successfully developed a simple Image Encryption Tool using pixel manipulation as part of my internship with Prodigy Infotech.✨🔐 This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing operations like pixel swapping and applying basic mathematical functions-ensuring secure handling of visual data.🚀Excited to learn something new
# 🔐 Simple Image Encryption Tool
## 🧩 Features
- 🔁 Encrypt images using pixel manipulation (e.g., pixel swapping)
- 🔓 Decrypt encrypted images back to their original form
- 🖼️ Supports common image formats (e.g., PNG, JPG)
- 💡 Simple and minimal codebase — easy to understand and extend
